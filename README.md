# Intrinsic-Pigeon-pair-Preferences-Revealed-by-IVF

We provide program files and data files used in the paper "Intrinsic Pigeon-pair Preferences Revealed by IVF", including

A. Code files 

B. Data files for estimation 

C. Data file for figures and tables. 

■	Code files are divided into four parts: 

Part 1: Compilation of raw data (in STATA). 

Part 2: Estimation of the proportion of delivering mothers who adopt IVF in the mother group indexed by age (a) and family wealth-rank (w) in period (t) using Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) regression (in STATA). 

Part 3: Estimation of the gender preference parameters of first-birth mothers who adopt IVFs (using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE, in R). 

Part 4: Calculation of the MLE standard errors of parameters and the values used in Figures 3 and 4 based on the estimates obtained from Part 3 (in STATA). 

Part 5: To examine an alternative classification scheme, where wealth and age are divided into seven and five groups, respectively.

Part 6: To employ a logit regression to examine the effects of the IVF percentage, wealth, and the IVF success rate on multiple birth outcomes and the one-boy-one-girl twin rate.

■ Two data files are used for estimation: 

ivf_01.dta corresponds to Part 2, and 

ivf_02.dta corresponds to Part 3

■	The Data file for figures and tables include the values of figure 1 to 5, as well as table 1 and 2 (and Supplementary Material).
